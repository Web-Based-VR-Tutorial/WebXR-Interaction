# IEEE VR 2021 Web-Based VR Tutorial

This is a WebXR example that demonstrates asset loading and some basic interactions.

To work with this sample, you should have Node (and in particular, npm and npx) installed, which you can retrieve from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).  

## Running 

You set up the initial project by pulling the dependencies from npm with 
```
npm install
```

After that, you can compile and run a server with:
```
npm run start
```

For those familiar with Typescript, you do not have to run ```tsc``` to build the .js files from the .ts files;  ```npx``` builds them on the fly as part of running webpack.

You can run the sample by pointing your web browser at ```https://localhost:8080/index.html```
